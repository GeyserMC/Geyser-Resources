# Bedrock Block and Item Palettes

mappings-generator uses the block and item palettes dumped from Minecraft Bedrock using [ProxyPass](https://github.com/NukkitX/ProxyPass).

After running ProxyPass and connecting to it from Minecraft Bedrock the palettes should be dumped to the data folder. 

Currently mappings-generator only uses `runtime_item_states.json`, so copy that file to this directory.
