# Bedrock Block and Item Palettes

mappings-generator uses the block and item palettes dumped from Minecraft Bedrock using [ProxyPass](https://github.com/NukkitX/ProxyPass).

The required palettes are included in this repository, however if you would like to dump your own, follow these steps:

After running ProxyPass and connecting to it from Minecraft Bedrock the palettes should be dumped to the data folder. 

Currently, mappings-generator only uses `runtime_item_states.json` and `runtime_block_states.json`, copy those file to this directory.
